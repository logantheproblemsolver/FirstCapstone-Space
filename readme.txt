Name of the web application: Space Exploration
Link to the webpage: https://logantheproblemsolver.github.io/FirstCapstone-Space/
Summary of the App: 
This app is used to search about space. Using NASA's image API and youtube's API you're able to search a space topic and it will bring you images and videos on that topic. 
The other part of the app is using NASA's picture of the day API and youtube's API. If you pick a day, then a picture and a description of the picture will pop up. Also, you'll have videos pop up as well on that topic. 
This is meant to be an easier way to get to learn about space. 
Languages used: I used HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery to build this web application
