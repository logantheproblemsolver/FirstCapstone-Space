            <p>Long ago we were people that stared at space and could only imagine what it is filled with. From that curiosity multiple stories were told to fill the void where science was unable to take us.</p>
            <p>Then. in 1957 is when Sputnik 1 was launched. That was the beginning to a new space era. New discoveries made each year about space. To this day we are still trying to figure it out.</p>
            <p>The difference from back then to now is that we have computers that can show us space at our fingertips. We don't have to be rocket scientist to explore space anymore. </p>
            <p>Let's learn about space together, shall we?</p>
