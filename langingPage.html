            <p>Long ago we were people that stared at Space and could only imagine what it could be filled it. Multiple stories to fill the void where science was unable to take us.</p>
            <p>Flashback to 1957 when Sputnik 1 was launched. That was the beginning to a new way of looking at space. New discoveries made each year about space. To this day we are still trying to figure out space.</p>
            <p>The difference from back then to now is that we have computers that can show us space at our fingertips. We don't have to be rocket scientist to explore space anymore. </p>
            <p>Let's learn about space together, shall we?</p>
